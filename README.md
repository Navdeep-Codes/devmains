Welcome to **Devmains** — a service that gives you free subdomains like `subdomain.is-open-source.org` and more!  
We aim to help developers easily get a free subdomain for their open-source projects.

## How to Get a Free Subdomain?

1. **Fork** this repo.
2. **Pick a domain folder** inside `/domains/` (example: `is-open-source.org/`).
3. **Create a `.json` file** with your subdomain request.
4. Use this format:

```json
{
  "subdomain": "yourname",
  "owner": {
    "repo": "https://github.com/yourgithubusername/yourrepository",
    "email": "youremail@example.com",
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "yourhosting.com"
  }
}
```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**.
6. **Wait for approval** — that's it!

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
/domains
   /is-open-source.org
      yourname.json
      anothername.json
   /future-domain.com
      yourname.json
```

- Each main domain (like `is-open-source.org`) has its own folder.
- Add your subdomain inside the correct domain folder.
- Later, more domains will be available!
